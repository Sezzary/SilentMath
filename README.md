Experimental implementations:
- Math wrappers and functions
- Input handling
- Various utils pulled from other projects
- Renderer (learning OpenGL, and *maybe* Vulkan, who knows if anything will come of it)
- Window handling
- Configuration handling
- Timestep handling
- Parallel (multi-threaded) task handling
- Portability in mind for multi-platform support

Libraries in use:
- GLAD
- GLM
- ImGui
- json
- OpenGL 4.6
- SDL3
- spdlog
- Vulkan
