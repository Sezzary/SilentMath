*Silent Engine* is an in-progress cross-platform engine port designed to run the original *Silent Hill* on modern systems. It aims to be a monolithic, flexible, and future-proof foundation with modern standards that will enable long-term goals such as translation support and modding. Written from the ground-up with a high-quality, no-compromise codebase.

*Q: CAN I PLAY THIS?*
Not yet! While some core logic has been migrated from our decompilation repository, the priority is building a stable engine foundation before integrating gameplay and graphics. I prioritize maintainability over quick, observable progress I can show off; simply getting the game to "work" is secondary to avoiding long-term technical debt. Additionally, much of the decompiled source still requires documentation and deobfuscation. Despite what completion metrics might suggest, the decompiled game code is hardly in a usable state, and rushing the port while the base source is being refined would be a mistake. However, the boot process, FMV playback, and main menus are already roughly functional, with progress on various rebuilt subsystems steadily underway alongside research of the original PSX code.

Decompilation progress can be tracked here:

## Contributing

Contributions to the decompilation repository are welcome. We need more people to help document, deobduscate, and conduct general research on the original PSX code.
As for this project: it's still rather early to ramp up the effort, but you are free to take a look around in the meantime! Discussion and updates can be found on the [PS1/PS2 Decompilation](https://discord.gg/VwCPdfbxgm) Discord server (`#Multi-Platform Port (Silent Engine)` thread under the `#silent-hill` channel).

## Prospects

- Easy to use.
- Windows/macOS/Linux support out of the box, with the potential for other platforms later.
- Modern renderer supporting Vulkan, DX12, and Metal, with the potential for other backends in the future.
- Keyboard/mouse and gamepad support.
- Widescreen and CRT filter support,
- Retro and HD font options  (.TTF fonts matching the originals have been found or meticulously recreated, allowing for modern font rendering to take place without relying on the original sprites).
- Various graphics toggles for a retro or modern look.
- Clean, well-documented codebase.
- Lua scripting.
- Translation support.
- Modding support.
- Custom levels (ambition for the far future).

## Current foundations

- Simple launcher with automated asset extraction from a user-provided compatible ROM
- User config options handling
- User savegame handling
- Input handling
- Math wrappers and functions (similar to DXTK but with some usability improvements)
- Window handling
- Asset streaming
- Timestep handling
- Parallel task handling
- Filesystem handling
- Extensive warning and error logging
- Renderer with swappable backends
- Translator for internationalized scripts
- Font manager
  FMV video player
- Debug menu
- Various utilities pulled from other projects

### TODOs

- Stability.
- Switch to GCC as the compiler on Windows with MinGW.
- Forward renderer.
- Parsers for all proprietary game file types.
- Lua scripting.
- Decompiled code migration.

## Building (Windows/macOS/Linux)

NOTE: Project setup is yet to be streamlined and this section is incomplete. Ideally, the project will be able to cross-compile between all main development platforms.

### Prerequisites

Install the required system tools.

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

```
winget install Kitware.CMake Git.Git Ninja-build.Ninja Python.Python.3
```
</details> <details> <summary>macOS</summary>

```
brew install cmake git ninja ffmpeg python
```
</details> <details> <summary>Linux</summary>

```
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ffmpeg git ninja-build python3 python3-pip python3-tk
```
</details>

### Clone the repository

Initialize Git LFS to ensure assets are pulled correctly.
```
git lfs install
```

Clone https://github.com/Sezzary/SilentEngine to your desired directory. Cloning recursively will include submodules in the process.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Sezzary/SilentEngine
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build the LuaJIT dependency locally.
```
cd Libraries/LuaJIT && make && cd ../..
```

Set up a Python virtual environment and activate it.
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install required Python packages.
```
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```

<summary>Linux</summary>

Install SDL dependencies.
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential git make \
pkg-config cmake ninja-build gnome-desktop-testing libasound2-dev libpulse-dev \
libaudio-dev libfribidi-dev libjack-dev libsndio-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev \

libegl1-mesa-dev libdbus-1-dev libibus-1.0-dev libudev-dev libthai-dev
```
</details>

### Build the code (Debug/Release)

- Configure Debug:`cmake -S . -B Build/Debug -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`
- Build Debug: `cmake --build Build/Debug`

- Configure Release:`cmake -S . -B Build/Release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
- Build Release: `cmake --build Build/Release`

### Transfer assets

Copy the `Assets` folder (containing custom supplementary files) from the root of the repository to the `Build` folder. Then, run the `Launcher` utility to extract all required original assets from a 1.1 US release of the game. Note this utility is rather barebones at the moment and works silently in the background when extraction begins.
Original game assets are not provided and your own ROM must be sourced.
